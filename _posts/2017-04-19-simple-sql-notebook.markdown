Last month I noticed that something like jupyter notebook but just for quering databases it would be very useful for me. That's because me and some colleagues do many analyzes with sql queries and those analyzes are kept on our local machines. 

So I created that "Simple SQL Notebook". It creates a tool where we can make the analyzes and easily share or even put them to a VCS.
